# My custom OSMTracker layouts

*Please note: This is work in progress!*

Custom buttons layouts for [OSMTracker for Android](https://github.com/nguillaumin/osmtracker-android). The default button layout does not really fit my needs when I walk around mapping.

So after I [found out](http://socc-cacher.de/index.php/blog/160-einfaches-datensammeln-fuer-openstreetmap-mit-osmtracker) that OSMTracker can use [custom buttons layouts](https://github.com/nguillaumin/osmtracker-android/wiki/Custom-buttons-layouts) in addition to the default one, I started creating my own layouts.
 
## Layouts

### City (city.xml)

This layout contains useful POIs for mapping a city. I omitted some of the most frequent POI types that are usually already mapped.

## Icons

The icons used in my layouts were created using the [fa2png.io](http://fa2png.io/) service and the [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/).

Icons and icon fonts used:

* Many of the icon fonts listed [here](http://fa2png.io/fonts/)
* bench icon by [Sitara Shah](https://thenounproject.com/sitara.shah7) from the Noun Project ([CC BY 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/))
* Carrot icon by [Creative Stall](https://thenounproject.com/creativestall/) from the Noun Project ([CC BY 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/))
